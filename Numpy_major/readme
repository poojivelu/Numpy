🧮 NumPy Main Project
A hands-on project built using NumPy, focusing on numerical operations, data analysis, and array manipulations in Python.
This notebook demonstrates how NumPy can simplify complex mathematical and data processing tasks efficiently.

🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
1.Understand the fundamentals of NumPy arrays and their advantages over Python lists.
2.Learn array creation, indexing, slicing, and reshaping operations.
3.Perform mathematical, statistical, and logical computations using NumPy functions.
4.Apply NumPy to simple real-world data analysis scenarios.

🚀 Features
1.Create and manipulate NumPy arrays
2.Perform mathematical and statistical calculations
3.Explore slicing, indexing, and reshaping arrays
4.Demonstrate broadcasting and vectorization
5.Compare NumPy arrays with Python lists in terms of speed and memory
6.Use NumPy for small data analysis examples

🐛 Troubleshooting Kernel Issues: 
Restart kernel: Kernel → Restart & Clear Output Reinstall NumPy: pip install --upgrade numpy

Import Errors: Ensure NumPy is installed: pip install numpy Check Python version compatibility

Cell Not Running: Check if another cell is currently executing Restart the kernel and run again
