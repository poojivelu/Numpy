🎯 Project Overview
This interactive notebook serves as a hands-on tutorial for learning NumPy by building a student marks management system. It covers essential NumPy concepts including array creation, manipulation, statistical operations, and practical data analysis with live code execution and visualizations.

✨ Features
Module 1: Array Basics & Properties
Creating NumPy arrays from Python lists
Understanding array properties (shape, size, dtype, ndim)
Comparing NumPy arrays with Python lists

Module 2: Array Creation Functions
Range-based Creation: arange(), linspace()
Initialized Arrays: zeros(), ones(), empty(), full()
Special Matrices: identity(), eye()

Module 3: Array Manipulation
Shape Operations: reshape(), flatten(), ravel(), transpose()
Combining Arrays: concatenate(), vstack(), hstack(), hsplit()
Modification: repeat(), flip(), delete(), unique()
Type Conversion: astype(), copy(), view()

Practical Application
Statistical analysis (mean, sum, max, min, std)
Student performance tracking
Subject-wise analysis
Top performer identification
